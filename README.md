# Geometric-Computing
## Draw shapes using geometric computing
Given of set of points 
The code can do three things
### 1. Reconstruct triangulation of the set of points
### 2. Compute the Delauny triangulation using the Delauny Disk thereom
### 3. Curb reconstruction
Note that the boundry limits are:  0 < x< 500 and 0 < y < 500
